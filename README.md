Project: Tour Guide App
Create an app to guide a user around a city or location of your choice!

Nerd Guide is a tourism app for Nerds, showcasing venues of interest like board game cafes and arcades in a particular city (Cardiff, in this case). There are tabs for Boardgames, Videogames, Comics and Vinyl and each fragment shows three venues that might be appealing to nerds, including a brief bio, address, phone number and opening hours.
